*PASSWORD GENERATOR*

This project is a Random Password Generator developed using Python. The main objective of the project is to generate strong, secure, and unpredictable passwords by combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Such passwords are essential for improving security in applications, systems, and user accounts.

The program uses Python’s built-in string module to access different character sets and the random module to ensure randomness in password generation. The user can specify the desired length of the password, making the program flexible and customizable based on security requirements.

Working Principle:

* The program collects a pool of characters that includes:
* Alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase)
* Numbers (0–9)
* Special characters (such as @, #, $, etc.)

Using a loop, it randomly selects characters from this pool.
The selected characters are joined together to form a password of the specified length.
Finally, the generated password is displayed to the user.

Features:
* Generates strong and secure passwords
* Customizable password length
* Uses built-in Python libraries
* Simple and efficient implementation
* Reduces the risk of weak or predictable passwords

Applications:
* Creating passwords for user accounts
* Enhancing security in software systems
* Educational purpose for learning Python basics
* Useful for developers and system administrators
